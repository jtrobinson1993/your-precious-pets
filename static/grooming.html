              <p>At Your Precious Pets, grooming is our main focus. Our grooming appointments can be made Monday-Saturday and generally are morning times. We like to get your pups in early, give them some time to settle in and play a little, and then make sure we have enough time to groom them safely and correctly. When finished, you’re welcome to leave them for a little while if you like, or they can be picked up right away.</p>
              <p>Pricing varies just as the shapes, sizes, and coat types of our many dog friends vary. Give us a call for an estimate, or bring your pup by or show us a picture of them to get a better price. We offer a variety of grooming options from simple toe nail trims up to fully stylized grooms. If you aren’t sure what works best for you, we’ll work with you to figure out a good length and schedule.</p>
              <p>Feeling creative? We can also paint nails or dye fur for a little extra. Our products are vegetable based and dog safe.</p>
              <p>Additionally, we have a couple of spa options. A blueberry facial will freshen up tear stains and a sugar-paw scrub will help smooth out those rough paw pads. We can also brush teeth and give a spritz of cologne at the end of the groom for an extra special finish.</p>
